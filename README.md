# CHAOS: **CH**emical **A**dditives **O**ptimization **S**creening

**chaos** leverages Bayesian optimization to optimize additives for chemical reactions.

At the heart of CHAOS lies a robust Bayesian optimization engine. By harnessing the power of probabilistic modeling, we are able to efficiently search through the vast chemical space for optimal additives. Bayesian optimization balances exploration and exploitation, effectively narrowing down the vast chemical space to the most promising areas.

Buit on top of Gauche, it provides diverse compound and reaction representations together with custom Gaussian process kernel functions.

Visualisation of Bayezian optimization for additive screening. Starting from the HTE dataset, we propagate the data through the reaction encoder to obtain suitable reaction representations. Using these representations, we organise the latent space and select the initial data points to set up the Gaussian process surrogate model. The bo loop then runs for a selected number of iterations during which we reach the global optimum in terms of the highest yield.

## üöÄ Installation

To install the package we recommend using a conda environment:

```bash
$ conda env create --file environment.yaml
pip install rxnfp --no-deps
```

## üí™ Getting Started
To configure an optimization routine check the config.yaml file, update parameters and use:
```python
python train_cli.py --config run_config.yaml
```
To run a wandb sweep use the parameters from sweep_config.yaml to initialize the sweep.
